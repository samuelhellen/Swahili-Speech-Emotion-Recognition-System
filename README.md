# Skiza-App: Speech Emotion Recognition for Kenyan Swahili

Welcome to Skiza-App! This project focuses on developing and deploying a model to recognize emotions from speech, specifically tailored for Kenyan Swahili. The model leverages advanced machine learning techniques and is deployed using FastAPI for the backend API and a web interface for user interaction.

## **Installation**

To get started with Skiza-App, follow these steps to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/estherdatascientist/Swahili-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-System.git
cd Swahili-Speech-Emotion-Recognition-System
```

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Download and Prepare Data**

Ensure you have the Swahili speech dataset. Update the `data_dir` path in the configuration files to point to your dataset location.

### **5. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn**

If not included in `requirements.txt`, you may need to install FastAPI and Uvicorn separately:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Training the Model**

To train the model, run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script will load the dataset, preprocess the audio files, extract features, and train various models. The best-performing model (CatBoost) will be saved in the `models` directory.

### **2. Running the FastAPI Server**

To start the FastAPI server, use:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will run the API server, allowing you to access the user interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. The interface provides options to upload audio files and get emotion predictions.

### **3. Accessing the User Interface**

Once the FastAPI server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Here, you can interact with the Skiza-App by uploading audio files, folders, or long audio files for emotion analysis.

## **Features**

- **Emotion Recognition**: Detects emotions from audio clips in Kenyan Swahili.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Provides immediate feedback through the web interface.
- **API Integration**: Offers RESTful API access through FastAPI for integration with other systems.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.

## **Model Evaluation**

The CatBoost model achieved an accuracy of 87%, making it the best performer among the tested models. For details on model performance and evaluation, refer to the `evaluation` module in the codebase.

## **Deployment**

Skiza-App is deployed using:

- **FastAPI**: For building a RESTful API and serving the web interface to upload and analyze audio files.
- **Uvicorn**: As the ASGI server to run the FastAPI app.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:
